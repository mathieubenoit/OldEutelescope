When you compile you need to copy the resulting executable at the 
pixelman installation location. The Makefile uses the following env 
variable.  You must set it before compiling

PIXELMAN_INSTALL=/install_location_path

When you compile the resulting executable will be automatically copied 
one directory behind ../  So if you checkout your code at PIXELMAN_INSTALL
then you are ready to go.  You must execute from PIXELMAN_INSTALL

The recomendation is then the following:

1) Set the env var PIXELMAN_INSTALL=/install_location_path
2) Go to that location and checkout the code by doing
   svn co https://svn.cern.ch/reps/idarraga/batchpix/testcode
3) cd testcode ; make
4) cd .. ; ./batchpixel.exe

The env var should give you access to the following libs:

Located directly at $(PIXELMAN_INSTALL)

- libMpxManager.so
- liblMpxCtrl.so

And these two at $(PIXELMAN_INSTALL)/hwlibs

- libMpxHwUSB2.so
- libMpxHwUSB.so
- libMpxHwDummy.so

If there is any problem compiling it is most likely due to 
problems accessing these libs.  Check your env vars and your
current location.
